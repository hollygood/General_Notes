Difference between npm and bower:

1. Dependency: 

npm does nested dependency tree (size heavy) while Bower requires a flat dependency tree.

2. Modules vs globals:

Bower is about loading plain-old script files, it includes all your scripts in plain-old <script> in the <head> 
of your HTML.

npm uses CommonJS modules and explicit dependency injection. Anything inside a module is effectively namespaced,
it's not a global variable anymore.
